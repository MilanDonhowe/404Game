=> Refactor entity pool as a global array.
Basically seperate out the CanvasManager into a bunch
of functions.
=> Add CRUD capabilities to entity pool.

Add collision check function which works like so:

function checkCollision(x, y, entity_pool){
    for each object in entity_pool:
        if the object is at (x,y)
            return {index of object}
    return false (specified as no-collision)
}

Yeah let's function the fuck out of this.

Other things:
-> Make GameManager class (holds score, win/lose conditions, etc.)
-> Figure out graphics
-> center canvas element

L8R:
-> Work on finding optimizations for typescript compiler.
